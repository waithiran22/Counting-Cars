# Counting CarsðŸš—

## This repository presents the data analysis and findings from the Counting Cars project, where speeds of 150 vehicles were recorded. Conducted collaboratively by Waithira Ng'ang'a, Nicolas Navarro, and Avery Frick, the project offers insights into vehicle speed behavior in the area.
---
## Data DictionaryðŸ“–
The data for this project was collected individually from the speed rador on 30th St and 24th Avenue in Rock Island, IL.

Key Columns:

-Date: Date of the recorded observation.

-Temperature: Ambient temperature at the time of observation.

-Weather: Description of the prevailing weather conditions.

-Time: Timestamp of the observation.

-Speed: Vehicle speed captured by the radar.

-Color: Color of the vehicle.

-License Plate State: State of registration indicated by the license plate.

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
The data cleaning process includes ensuring proper date, time and temperature formats, and preparing the data for analysis.

## Graphs
### speed - temperature
<img src="CarGraphs/speedVStemperature1.png" height = 300, width = 450>

This graph is a scatter plot that examines the relationship between two continuous variables: the speed of cars (in mph) and the temperature (in Â°F) at the time the speed was recorded. Observing the image there is a cluster of data points spread vertically at specific temperatures (61Â°F, 67Â°F, and 71Â°F), representing the speed of the different cars recorded by the speed radar. The blue line explains the average speed at each level of temperature, which doesn't change too much. The flatness of the line indicates no strong positive or negative correlation between the temperature and the speed of cars. Apart from that, there are some outliers at both 61Â°F and 71Â°F.

```
#Scatter plot with a trend line for SPEED-TEMPERATURE
ggplot(car_data, aes(x = Temperature, y = Speed)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + # Alpha for transparency on points
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "blue", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    title = "Speed vs. Temperature",
    x = "Temperature (Â°F)",
    y = "Speed (mph)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )
```

### speed - state license plate
<img src="CarGraphs/speedVSlicenseplate1.png" height = 300, width = 450>

This is a segmented bar chart that displays the distribution of car speeds within different ranges for cars from different license plate states (IA for Iowa, IL for Illinois, and MI for Michigan).

```
#Categorizing the speeds into ranges
car_data$SpeedRange <- cut(car_data$Speed, breaks = seq(from = min(car_data$Speed), 
                                                        to = max(car_data$Speed), 
                                                        by = 5), 
                           include.lowest = TRUE)

#Creating a bar chart with these ranges
ggplot(car_data, aes(x = SpeedRange, fill = License_plate_state)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Count of Speed Ranges by License Plate State",
       x = "Speed Range (mph)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.6))
```

### speed - time of the day
<img src="CarGraphs/speedVStimeday1.png" height = 300, width = 600>

```
#Categorizing the times into sections of the day
car_data <- car_data %>%
  mutate(
    TimeOfDay = case_when(
      Hour >= 5 & Hour < 10 ~ "Early Morning",
      Hour >= 10 & Hour < 12 ~ "Mid Morning",
      Hour >= 12 & Hour < 14 ~ "Early Afternoon",
      Hour >= 14 & Hour < 17 ~ "Mid Afternoon",
      Hour >= 17 & Hour < 20 ~ "Evening",
      TRUE ~ "Night"
    )
  )

#To specify the order of the levels
car_data$TimeOfDay <- factor(
  car_data$TimeOfDay, 
  levels = c("Early Morning", "Mid Morning", "Early Afternoon", "Mid Afternoon", "Evening", "Night")
)
  
#Scatter plot of Speed vs. Time of Day
ggplot(car_data, aes(x = TimeOfDay, y = Speed)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = TimeOfDay)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +  
  labs(title = "Car Speed During Different Times of Day",
       x = "Time of Day",
       y = "Speed (mph)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  #to center the plot title
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Early Morning", "Mid Morning", "Early Afternoon", "Mid Afternoon", "Evening", "Night"))
