# Counting CarsðŸš—

## This repository presents the data analysis and findings from the Counting Cars project, where speeds of 150 vehicles were recorded. Conducted collaboratively by Waithira Ng'ang'a, Nicolas Navarro, and Avery Frick, the project offers insights into vehicle speed behavior in the area.
---
## Data DictionaryðŸ“–
The data for this project was collected individually from the speed rador on 30th St and 24th Avenue in Rock Island, IL.

Key Columns:

-Date: Date of the recorded observation.

-Temperature: Ambient temperature at the time of observation.

-Weather: Description of the prevailing weather conditions.

-Time: Timestamp of the observation.

-Speed: Vehicle speed captured by the radar.

-Color: Color of the vehicle.

-License Plate State: State of registration indicated by the license plate.

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
The data cleaning process includes ensuring proper date, time and temperature formats, and preparing the data for analysis.
